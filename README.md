######### CAR FIND HELPER ###########

This programme is used to help select a car, based on a number of given requirements. It is based on user ratings on the motofakty.pl website, from where information on the rating of the vehicle in question is taken. To save time that would have been spent on webcrawling, the basic data selected by the user is compared to a dataset created for this project. This dataset is a modification of the dataset from kaggle.com, and it contained information about the ads issued in 2021.
